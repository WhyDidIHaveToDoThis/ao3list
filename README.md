# Share, rank, and catalog fanfiction!

I will attempt to build something here.

Goals:
- Generate user profile
- Reading this month
- Statistics
  - Reading
  - Completed
  - Plan to watch
  - Words/chapters/stories
  - "dropped"
  - date started/finished
  - Subscribed
  - Authors
- Favorites
- Numerical Ranking
- Tierlist
- Fandom list
- Character list
- Pairing list
- Share!

How do I save all this data??? CSV?
It's just to generate a nice graphic when you import a text file of links, probably not saved on server.

Maybe possible
- Import Metadata
- Reminder to kudos
- Import from Calibre
